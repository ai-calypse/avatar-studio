All notable user-facing changes to Agent Robot Avatar are documented here.

The project follows Semantic Versioning for public releases. Internal development build numbers are not part of the public version history.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.2] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Added the `love` action: the eyes lean together into a heart, beat three times, then return.
- Added the `random` action (alias `slot`): the eyes roll like slot-machine reels, then settle with a bounce.

### Fixed

- `love` now shows the full heart under reduced motion, and `love` and `random` follow motion preference changes while they play.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- Restored the existing head-drag, waiting, sleep-wake, and touch-cancel behavior alongside press-and-hold squeezing by deferring squeeze activation until the hold is confirmed.
- Refined the wrap waiting animation with shared rotational projection, optical height compensation, and edge contact so the eyes turn around the head without overlapping, clipping, or using transparency.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Added a second waiting choice, `startWaiting({ variant: 'wrap' })`, with the approved 2.4-second left-out/right-in eye turn and custom easing. `play('waiting-wrap')` plays one cycle; the original waiting remains available and is the default.
- Added center press-and-hold squeezing, sustained compression tremor, and spring/jelly release. Moving more than 4 CSS pixels transfers the gesture to the existing head drag.
- Added antenna dragging with the head drag's 25-unit pull cap, a localized head deformation, a firmer spring return, and the existing angry reaction after recovery.
- Added `setPressSqueeze()` and `setAntennaDrag()` opt-outs, interaction state events, and reduced-motion behavior.
- Added localized “Try” tags below the Demo status for double-clicking, head dragging, center press-and-hold squeezing, and antenna dragging.

### Changed

- Renamed and repositioned the Demo action as “Waiting · Wrap” directly after the original waiting action.

### Fixed

- Kept both eyes looking at the live pointer position throughout antenna dragging instead of returning them to center when the drag begins.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Unified synchronous `size` attribute parsing so numeric and `px` values use the same validation immediately, without a transient fallback before runtime observers run.
- Added the existing public `sleep()`, `wake()`, and `input()` convenience methods to the TypeScript declaration surface and type checks.
- Stabilized request-replacement race tests by ordering competing clicks in the same browser task instead of depending on an 80 ms wall-clock window.
- Expanded package integrity coverage to require the runtime and geometry modules explicitly.

- Prevented the accessible request lifecycle example's delayed replacement step from starting after cancellation, a newer user request, or a newer replacement flow has invalidated it.
- Made the example's business status the only automatic live region; the visible request debug log remains available for deliberate reading without `role="log"` live semantics or whole-log text rewrites.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Prevented disconnect cleanup from recreating per-instance media-query listeners and observers; reattaching now initializes connected runtime resources once without emitting cleanup-only lifecycle events.
- Decoupled automatic sleep timing from frame rendering so `motion="reduce"` can pause continuous drawing without disabling `auto-sleep`, while active waiting/input continue to take priority.
- Ensured reduced-motion state changes commit their final static SVG before rendering pauses, including the fully closed sleep pose.
- Made `stopWaiting()` terminate the action it actually resets: waiting ends normally, other active program actions are cancelled once, and idle calls emit no false terminal event.
- Separated explicit `noteActivity()` calls from ambient DOM activity so host calls inside real event handlers keep API semantics while automatic wakeups continue to obey `wake-on`.
- Restricted action alias lookup to declared keys so prototype-like names such as `constructor` and `__proto__` fail before changing waiting/action state.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Added `wake-on="activity|interaction|manual"` to control automatic wake behavior while preserving `activity` as the default.
- Added `motion="auto|reduce|full"`; `auto` follows `prefers-reduced-motion` and updates when the system preference changes.
- Added the semantic `action-state` event with `{ action, phase, source }` lifecycle data for host integrations and accessible status messaging.
- Added explicit `px` support for `size`, alongside existing numeric pixel values.
- Added Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browser validation, including trusted Chromium touch-cancellation coverage.

### Changed

- Unified program-action and drag cancellation so reset, replacement actions, disconnect, and pointer cancellation cannot leave delayed drag reactions behind.
- Program-controlled actions such as waiting and input now keep ownership of their expression while drag deformation remains available; suppressed drag reactions are discarded rather than replayed.
- Invalid/no-op actions are validated before destructive extension cleanup, so an invalid `wake` or unknown action cannot tear down a running action.
- Touch interaction uses `touch-action: pinch-zoom` on the avatar interaction region so single-pointer dragging remains available while page scrolling outside the avatar is unaffected and two-finger zoom remains possible.
- Reduced-motion mode removes continuous decorative motion while preserving distinct static states and semantic action lifecycles.
- Avatars pause sustained frame rendering when hidden, without layout, or outside the viewport, then resume the current state when visible again.
- High-frequency pointer updates are coalesced to the latest update per animation frame.
- Shared the head-flattening geometry used by the antenna and roundness modules.

### Fixed

- Preserved valid `window.AgentRobotAvatarInspectConfig` values supplied before module loading and normalized missing, invalid, and out-of-range values deterministically.
- Distinguished `pointercancel` from a normal release so cancelled touch gestures recover without success/angry feedback.
- Tightened `size` parsing so unsupported units, malformed values, zero, negative, and non-finite input use the default size instead of being partially parsed as pixels.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Fixed dynamic custom-element creation failing because the constructor added a host style attribute; preserved default and explicit sizing.
- Prevented interrupted expression continuations and animation callbacks from overriding resets or newer actions.
- Fixed automatic sleep repeatedly restarting its own preparation instead of reaching sleep.
- Synchronized dynamic head colors with the eye masks and antenna, including while sleep rendering is paused.
- Cancelled pending timers, animations, waiting, and drag feedback on disconnect; reattached avatars start idle with their settings preserved.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-04

First stable release of the backward-compatible 0.2 series.

### Added

- Added Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and French documentation.
- Added package, installation, server-import, and real-browser smoke tests.
- Added `setAntennaFlash(enabled)` for per-avatar antenna flashing.
- Added built-in TypeScript declarations for actions, events, and public methods.

### Changed

- Added a lightweight animated GIF preview for the README documentation.
- Moved localized README files into the `docs/` directory and added a unified language selector.
- Moved the interactive Demo and Windows launcher into the `demo/` directory.
- Removed runtime Demo badge logic and cache-busting query strings from internal module imports.
- Made the package safe to import in server-side JavaScript without browser globals.
- Corrected package side-effect metadata so bundlers preserve custom-element registration.
- Added typed package exports and automated declaration checks for npm consumers.
- Added an npm release rehearsal command and forced publishing to the official npm registry.
- Replaced four layers of runtime method wrapping with a shared extension registry.
- Routed built-in actions and antenna drawing through the same registry, leaving one lifecycle entry point.
- Shared global input listeners across avatar instances and paused frame rendering after sleep animations settle.
